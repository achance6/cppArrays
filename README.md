# cppArrays
Some arrays implemented using linked lists

Unique.cpp is not implemented yet. It will be a program to count all unique words in a text using these data structures.

ListArray is a simple array implemented using a linked list.

SparseArray is similarly an array implemented using a linked list; however, it contains a default value that isn't inserted if user tries to insert it. Good for data with lots of same values.
